          I&apos;m Biniyam Beyene, a passionate Full-Stack Developer from
          Ethiopia. I&apos;ve been learning and building in the programming
          world for over 3 years. Since high school, I&apos;ve pursued my
          passion for software development and enjoyed working across both
          front-end and back-end. My favorite part of development is solving
          complex problems and turning ideas into functional applications. Along
          the way, I&apos;ve built a variety of projects â€” from personal
          experiments to collaborative ventures.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          My core stack includes React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS on
          the the front-end, with Node.js, Nest.js, Laravel, and Django powering
          the back-end. I also develop cross-platform apps with Flutter, and
          I&apos;m experienced with databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
          I&apos;m always exploring new technologies to sharpen my skills and
          stay current.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m open to job opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and
          continuously improve as a developer. If you have a role that aligns
          with my skills and experience, feel free to reach out!
